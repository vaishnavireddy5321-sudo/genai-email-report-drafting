Professional communication through emails and reports is a time-consuming and repetitive activity in corporate and academic environments. This project presents an **AI-Driven Email and Report Drafting System** that leverages **Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)** using **Google Gemini Large Language Models** to automatically generate high-quality, context-aware written content.

The system is implemented using an **N-Tier architecture** comprising a **React.js with TypeScript frontend**, a **Flask-based RESTful backend**, and a **PostgreSQL database**. Secure access control is enforced using **JWT-based authentication** with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. The solution demonstrates how Generative AI can be integrated into enterprise-grade software systems while maintaining controlled complexity suitable for academic evaluation.

The system employs **instruction-based prompt engineering** optimized for Google Gemini's instruction-following capabilities. Users can generate professional emails and reports by providing purpose, tone, and contextual inputs. All generated content is persisted in the database for future reference and auditing purposes.

The project successfully demonstrates the practical application of Generative AI within a secure, enterprise-style architecture. By balancing simplicity and architectural rigor, the system provides a strong academic foundation while remaining extensible for real-world deployment scenarios.
